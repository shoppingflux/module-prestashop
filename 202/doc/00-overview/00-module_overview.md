The [Shopping Feed API documentation](https://developer.shopping-feed.com/getting-started/introduction)
...Which shouldn't be necessary since we're using the [Shopping Feed PHP SDK](https://github.com/shoppingflux/php-sdk).

This module will replace the shoppingfluxexport module since version 1.4+. It's purpose
is to keep the shop's data up to date with the marketplaces managed by Shopping
Feed, reciprocally; hence the "synchronization".

This allows the merchant to manage all his orders and catalog from his shop,
instead of managing his business on each marketplace.
