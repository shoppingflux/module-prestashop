### Shopping Feed API

[Shopping Feed's PHP SDK](https://github.com/shoppingflux/php-sdk); this module
uses version `0.2.4`, which creates some [problems](/#2-problem-guzzle-trouble).

[Shopping Feed's PHP Feed Generator](https://github.com/shoppingflux/php-feed-generator); this module
uses version `1.2.0`.


**DO NOT** run `composer install` without reading about our [problems with
Guzzle](/#2-problem-guzzle-trouble) !
Running `composer dump-autoload` should be fine, though.

## Installation for merchands

To install module on PrestaShop, download zip package supply by ShoppingFeed customer service or the zip file
named [v1.x.x-prod-shoppingfeed.zip](https://github.com/shoppingflux/module-prestashop/releases) attached on each detail release page.

## Installation for developpers

If you are a developper, this module contain composer.json.dist file. If you clone or download the module from github
repository, run the ```composer install``` is not necessary. You can see why on [module documentation][module-doc] on "Guzzle trouble".

See the [composer documentation][composer-doc] to learn more about the composer.json file.

You can also use docker compose to install the module on a fresh ready to use PrestaShop version.

## Compiling assets
**For development**

We use _Webpack_ to compile our javascript and scss files.
In order to compile those files, you must :
1. have _Node 10+_ installed locally
2. run `npm install` in the root folder to install dependencies
3. then run `npm run watch` to compile assets and watch for file changes

**For production**

Run `npm run build` to compile for production.
Files are minified, `console.log` and comments dropped.
