Hi,

There are some errors during synchronization of your orders with marketplaces
via Shopping Feed. Please check the list of order with errors below :

{list_order_sync_errors_txt}

Please try to synchronize the orders again using your Cron Task URL (you can get
it via your PrestaShop BackOffice, «15 Min Marketplace Updates – Shopping Feed»
module settings, «Cron Tasks» page). You can see more details in the «Tasks
Activity» page.
